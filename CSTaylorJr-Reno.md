# Reno, NV

### Restaurants
- Pub & Sub: located near the univerity, this is a favorite hang-out for students.

### Attractions for Tourists
#### Casinos
- The Nugget: Actually located in Sparks (the town next to Reno), the guy who founded this casino has a trick memory.  He never forgets a face!

- Harrahs: This is the big casino in the middle of town. Actually, Harrahs has shifted hotels over the years...and has several casinos all over the place.

- Peppermill: A local favorite, Peppermill is a little way off the strip.  This gives it a feel that's a little unique.  Check out the fireside lounge--the pool of water with the fire is pretty cool!

### Attractions for Locals
While some locals also like to gamble, there's also a lot of outdoor activities available if one is willing to go a little ways out from the city.  Lake Tahoe is only an hour away.  There, during the summer, there's a lot of water activities--sailing, swimming, waterskiing, fishing, etc.  In winter, there's skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports.
